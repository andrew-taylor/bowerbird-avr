* fix initialisation/configuration so it uses the mic/pre-amps defined in Descriptors.c
* debug why gain setting doesn't always work
* check out if timer interrupt is screwing up gain setting/reading

Future ideas
================================
* Version 2 of the spec (Formats20 final.pdf) supports Extended Audio Data
Formats, which include the ability to timestamp each sample (e.g. from our GPS)
* specify microphone coordinates so can use standardised code in ARM?
